1). CAMP-stock_market research is devoted to systematic stock risk in Russia. The research is  based on the CAPM regression model and its application to the Russian market. The research consists of 4 relatively independent parts:

  1. The best indicator for CAPM
  2. Structural shifts in the stock market
  3. Dependence of changes in the MOEX index
  4. Influence of commodity and currency indices

  As a result, we formulated several conclusions that, in our opinion, can be useful for   investment analysts and financiers.
