Our research is devoted to systematic stock risk in Russia. The research is based on the CAPM regression model and its application to the Russian market. The research consists of 4 relatively independent parts:

1. The best indicator for CAPM
2. Structural shifts in the stock market
3. Dependence of changes in the MOEX index
4. Influence of commodity and currency indices

As a result, we formulated several conclusions that, in our opinion, can be useful for investment analysts and financiers.
